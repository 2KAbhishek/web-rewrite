## What is this

web-rewrite is a utility that allows you to rewrite your URLs.

## Inspiration

I wanted to write my own url shortener and then came accross appwrite, which motivated me enough to do it.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of `node`, `appwrite`
- web-rewrite needs the following env vars to function correctly

```bash
HOST=appwrite-console-host
APPWRITE_PORT=80 #Port where appwrite console is running
PROJECT_ID=project-id-from-appwrite-console
API_KEY=api-key-from-appwrite-console
APP_PORT=4321 # The port where you want web-rewrite to run
LINKS_COLLECTION_ID=links-collection-id1 #Try changing this if setup fails
```

## Getting web-rewrite

To install web-rewrite, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/web-rewrite
cd web-rewrite
touch .env
npm run setup # Sets up the links collection in appwrite
npm start
```

## Using web-rewrite

After starting the app you can visit the app through your browser.

## How it was built

web-rewrite was built using `node`, `express` and `appwrite`

## Challenges faced

While building web-rewrite the main challenges were:

- Setting up AppWrite collections through node was tricky

## What I learned

- AppWrite and it's different services, will use it more in upcoming projects
- Web routing

## What's next

May deploy it somewhere soon
